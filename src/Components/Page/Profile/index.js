                        In this special moment, I would like to introduce myself. I am Ade Dwi Putra. You can call me Ade. I was born on December 30rd, 1998 in Pangkalpinang, Bangka-Belitung Island. I live at Al-Hayati I street Est Kace, with my parents and two siblings (one older brother and one younger sister). So, I am the second child in my family. The school subjects that I love are Programming and Science. They are so challenging but also fun. I love reading Science Fiction books because they are very imaginative. They are full of innovative and creative ideas. Science Fiction movies such as Interstellar, Avatar, Star Wars are the movies I enjoy watching because they are so awesome. Besides, I love travelling, listening to music and playing games. I usually play games with my siblings and sometimes with my parents. We have so much fun. Thatâ€™s all about myself. Thank you for your attention
